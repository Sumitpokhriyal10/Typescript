//learning typescript some problem in js

//1.
//let balance=200;

//balance="sumit" //someone reassigned the value of balnce as a string leading to invalid output
//console.log(balance*10);

//2. suppose age is coming from backend 
//let age =20;

//age ="twenty"  //and developer wrote it like this 

//console.log(age+10) //it leads to output twenty10 which was not desired

//3.in object

//let obj={
  //  name:"sumit",
  //  age:23
//}

//console.log(obj.len)  //object dont contain any len function inside it but it should give error but it is not ggiving error instead we see result as undefined
//main problem with js is it tries togive us answer even when we do anything


//TYPSRIPT CURED THESE PROBLEM BY DEFINING TYPE OF VARIABLES
